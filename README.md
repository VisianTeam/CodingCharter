## Comments

- Don't follow guidelines as they were absolute rules. They are here to ensure consistency, but overall:

    - Readable and Understandable always prevail
    
    - Consistency with surrounding code prevails

- Simplify your documentation and variable naming using [shortforms](shortforms.md)

- Code and documentation must be written in english
